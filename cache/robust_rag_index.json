    "the-wee-bannock": "there was once an old man and his wife , who lived in a dear little cottage by the side of a burn . they were a very canty and contented couple , for they had enough to live on , and enough to do . indeed , they considered themselves quite rich , for , besides their cottage and their garden , they possessed two sleek cows , five hens and a cock , an old cat , and two kittens . the old man spent his time looking after the cows , and the hens , and the garden ; while the old woman kept herself busy spinning . one day , just after breakfast , the old woman thought that she would like an oatmeal bannock for her supper that evening , so she took down her bakeboard , and put on her girdle , and baked a couple of fine cakes , and when they were ready she put them down before the fire to harden . while they were toasting , her husband came in from the byre , and sat down to take a rest in his great arm - chair . presently his eyes fell on the bannocks , and , as they looked very good , he broke one through the middle and began to eat it . when the other bannock saw this it determined that it should not have the same fate , so it ran across the kitchen and out of the door as fast as it could . and when the old woman saw it disappearing , she ran after it as fast as her legs would carry her , holding her spindle in one hand and her distaff in the other . but she was old , and the bannock was young , and it ran faster than she did , and escaped over the hill behind the house . it ran , and it ran , and it ran , until it came to a large newly thatched cottage , and , as the door was open , it took refuge inside , and ran right across the floor to a blazing fire , which was burning in the first room that it came to . now , it chanced that this house belonged to a tailor , and he and his two apprentices were sitting cross - legged on the top of a big table by the window , sewing away with all their might , while the tailor 's wife was sitting beside the fire carding lint . when the wee bannock came trundling across the floor , all three tailors got such a fright that they jumped down from the table and hid behind the master tailor 's wife . \" hoot , \" she said , \" what a set of cowards ye be ! it is but a nice wee bannock . get hold of it and divide it between you , and i 'll fetch you all a drink of milk . \" while they were toasting , her husband came in from the byre , and sat down to take a rest in his great arm - chair . presently his eyes fell on the bannocks , and , as they looked very good , he broke one through the middle and began to eat it . when the other bannock saw this it determined that it should not have the same fate , so it ran across the kitchen and out of the door as fast as it could . and when the old woman saw it disappearing , she ran after it as fast as her legs would carry her , holding her spindle in one hand and her distaff in the other . but she was old , and the bannock was young , and it ran faster than she did , and escaped over the hill behind the house . it ran , and it ran , and it ran , until it came to a large newly thatched cottage , and , as the door was open , it took refuge inside , and ran right across the floor to a blazing fire , which was burning in the first room that it came to . now , it chanced that this house belonged to a tailor , and he and his two apprentices were sitting cross - legged on the top of a big table by the window , sewing away with all their might , while the tailor 's wife was sitting beside the fire carding lint . when the wee bannock came trundling across the floor , all three tailors got such a fright that they jumped down from the table and hid behind the master tailor 's wife . \" hoot , \" she said , \" what a set of cowards ye be ! it is but a nice wee bannock . get hold of it and divide it between you , and i 'll fetch you all a drink of milk . \"  now , it chanced that this house belonged to a tailor , and he and his two apprentices were sitting cross - legged on the top of a big table by the window , sewing away with all their might , while the tailor 's wife was sitting beside the fire carding lint . when the wee bannock came trundling across the floor , all three tailors got such a fright that they jumped down from the table and hid behind the master tailor 's wife . \" hoot , \" she said , \" what a set of cowards ye be ! it is but a nice wee bannock . get hold of it and divide it between you , and i 'll fetch you all a drink of milk . \" so she jumped up with her lint and her lint cards , and the tailor jumped up with his great shears , and one apprentice grasped the line measure , while another took up the saucer full of pins ; and they all tried to catch the wee bannock . but it dodged them round and round the fire , and at last it got safely out of the door and ran down the road , with one of the apprentices after it , who tried to snip it in two with his shears . it ran too quickly for him , however , and at last he stopped and went back to the house , while the wee bannock ran on until it came to a tiny cottage by the roadside . it trundled in at the door , and there was a weaver sitting at his loom , with his wife beside him , winding a clue of yarn .  so she jumped up with her lint and her lint cards , and the tailor jumped up with his great shears , and one apprentice grasped the line measure , while another took up the saucer full of pins ; and they all tried to catch the wee bannock . but it dodged them round and round the fire , and at last it got safely out of the door and ran down the road , with one of the apprentices after it , who tried to snip it in two with his shears . it ran too quickly for him , however , and at last he stopped and went back to the house , while the wee bannock ran on until it came to a tiny cottage by the roadside . it trundled in at the door , and there was a weaver sitting at his loom , with his wife beside him , winding a clue of yarn . \" what 's that , tibby ? \" said the weaver , with a start as the little cake flew past him . \" oh ! \" cried she in delight , jumping to her feet , \" it is a wee bannock . i wonder where it came from ? \" \" dinna bother your head about that , tibby , \" said her man , \" but grip it , my woman , grip it . \"  but it was not so easy to get hold of the wee bannock . it was in vain that the goodwife threw her clue at it , and that the goodman tried to chase it into a corner and knock it down with his shuttle . it dodged , and turned , and twisted , like a thing bewitched , till at last it flew out at the door again , and vanished down the hill , \" for all the world , \" as the old woman said , \" like a new tarred sheep , or a daft cow . \" in the next house that it came to it found the goodwife in the kitchen , kirning . she had just filled her kirn , and there was still some cream standing in the bottom of her cream jar . \" come away , little bannock , \" she cried when she saw it . \" thou art come in just the nick of time , for i am beginning to feel hungry , and i 'll have cakes and cream for my dinner . \" but the wee bannock hopped round to the other side of the kirn , and the goodwife after it . and she was in such a hurry that she nearly upset the kirn ; and by the time that she had put it right again , the wee bannock was out at the door and half - way down the brae to the mill . the miller was sifting meal in the trough , but he straightened himselfup when he saw the little cake . \" it 's a sign of plenty when bannocks are running about with no one to look after them , \" he said ; \" but i like bannocks and cheese , so just come in , and i will give thee a night 's lodging . \" but the little bannock had no wish to be eaten up by the miller , so it turned and ran out of the mill , and the miller was so busy that he did not trouble himself to run after it . after this it ran on , and on , and on , till it came to the smithy , and it popped in there to see what it could see . the smith was busy at the anvil making horse - shoe nails , but he looked up as the wee bannock entered . \" if there be one thing i am fond of , it is a glass of ale and a well - toasted cake , \" he cried . \" so come inside here , and welcome to you . \" but as soon as the little bannock heard of the ale , it turned and ran out of the smithy as fast as it could , and the disappointed smith picked up his hammer and ran after it . and when he saw that he could not catch it , he flung his heavy hammer at it , in the hope of knocking it down , but , luckily for the little cake , he missed his aim . after this the bannock came to a farmhouse , with a great stack of peats standing at the back of it . in it went , and ran to the fireside . in this house the master had all the lint spread out on the floor , and was cloving it with an iron rod , while the mistress was heckling what he had already cloven . \" oh , janet , \" cried the goodman in surprise , \" here comes in a little bannock . it looks rare and good to eat . i 'll have one half of it . \" \" and i 'll have the other half , \" cried the goodwife . \" hit it over the back with your cloving - stick , sandy , and knock it down . quick , or it will be out at the door again . \" but the bannock played \" jook - about , \" and dodged behind a chair . \" hoot ! \" cried janet contemptuously , for she thought that her husband might easily have hit it , and she threw her heckle at it . but the heckle missed it , just as her husband 's cloving - rod had done , for it played \" jook - about \" again , and flew out of the house . this time it ran up a burnside till it came to a little cottage standing among the heather . here the goodwife was making porridge for the supper in a pot over the fire , and her husband was sitting in a corner plaiting ropes of straw with which to tie up the cow . \" oh , jock ! come here , come here , \" cried the goodwife . \" you are crying for a little bannock for your supper ; come here , histie , quick , and help me to catch it . \" \" ay , ay , \" assented jock , jumping to his feet and hurrying across the little room . \" but where is it ? i can not see it . \" \" there , man , there , \" cried his wife , \" under that chair . run thou to that side ; i will keep to this . \" this time it ran up a burnside till it came to a little cottage standing among the heather . here the goodwife was making porridge for the supper in a pot over the fire , and her husband was sitting in a corner plaiting ropes of straw with which to tie up the cow . \" oh , jock ! come here , come here , \" cried the goodwife . \" you are crying for a little bannock for your supper ; come here , histie , quick , and help me to catch it . \" \" ay , ay , \" assented jock , jumping to his feet and hurrying across the little room . \" but where is it ? i can not see it . \" \" there , man , there , \" cried his wife , \" under that chair . run thou to that side ; i will keep to this . \" so jock ran into the dark corner behind the chair ; but , in his hurry , he tripped and fell , and the wee bannock jumped over him and flew laughing out at the door . through the whins and up the hillside it ran , and over the top of the hill , to a shepherd 's cottage on the other side . the inmates were just sitting down to their porridge , and the goodwife was scraping the pan . \" save us and help us , \" she exclaimed , stopping with the spoon half - way to her mouth . \" there 's a wee bannock come in to warm itself at our fireside . \" \" sneck the door , \" cried the husband , \" and we 'll try to catch it . it would come in handy after the porridge . \"  while they were toasting , her husband came in from the byre , and sat down to take a rest in his great arm - chair . presently his eyes fell on the bannocks , and , as they looked very good , he broke one through the middle and began to eat it . when the other bannock saw this it determined that it should not have the same fate , so it ran across the kitchen and out of the door as fast as it could . and when the old woman saw it disappearing , she ran after it as fast as her legs would carry her , holding her spindle in one hand and her distaff in the other . but she was old , and the bannock was young , and it ran faster than she did , and escaped over the hill behind the house . it ran , and it ran , and it ran , until it came to a large newly thatched cottage , and , as the door was open , it took refuge inside , and ran right across the floor to a blazing fire , which was burning in the first room that it came to . \" if there be one thing i am fond of , it is a glass of ale and a well - toasted cake , \" he cried . \" so come inside here , and welcome to you . \" but as soon as the little bannock heard of the ale , it turned and ran out of the smithy as fast as it could , and the disappointed smith picked up his hammer and ran after it . and when he saw that he could not catch it , he flung his heavy hammer at it , in the hope of knocking it down , but , luckily for the little cake , he missed his aim . after this the bannock came to a farmhouse , with a great stack of peats standing at the back of it . in it went , and ran to the fireside . in this house the master had all the lint spread out on the floor , and was cloving it with an iron rod , while the mistress was heckling what he had already cloven . so jock ran into the dark corner behind the chair ; but , in his hurry , he tripped and fell , and the wee bannock jumped over him and flew laughing out at the door . through the whins and up the hillside it ran , and over the top of the hill , to a shepherd 's cottage on the other side . the inmates were just sitting down to their porridge , and the goodwife was scraping the pan . \" save us and help us , \" she exclaimed , stopping with the spoon half - way to her mouth . \" there 's a wee bannock come in to warm itself at our fireside . \" \" sneck the door , \" cried the husband , \" and we 'll try to catch it . it would come in handy after the porridge . \"  but the bannock did not wait until the door was sneckit . it turned and ran as fast as it could , and the shepherd and his wife and all the bairns ran after it , with their spoons in their hands , in hopes of catching it . and when the shepherd saw that it could run faster than they could , he threw his bonnet at it , and almost struck it ; but it escaped all these dangers , and soon it came to another house , where the folk were just going to bed . the goodman was half undressed , and the goodwife was raking the cinders carefully out of the fire . \" what 's that ? \" said he , \" for the bowl of brose that i had at supper - time was n't very big . \" \" catch it , then , \" answered his wife , \" and i 'll have a bit , too . quick ! quick ! throw your coat over it or it will be away . \" so the goodman threw his coat right on the top of the little bannock , and almost managed to smother it ; but it struggled bravely , and got out , breathless and hot , from under it . then it ran out into the grey light again , for night was beginning to fall , and the goodman ran out after it , without his coat . he chased it and chased it through the stackyard and across a field , and in amongst a fine patch of whins . then he lost it ; and , as he was feeling cold without his coat , he went home . as for the poor little bannock , it thought that it would creep under a whin bush and lie there till morning , but it was so dark that it never saw that there was a fox 's hole there . so it fell down the fox 's hole , and the fox was very glad to see it , for he had had no food for two days . \" oh , welcome , welcome , \" he cried ; and he snapped it through the middle with his teeth , and that was the end of the poor wee bannock . and if a moral be wanted for this tale , here it is : that people should never be too uplifted or too cast down over anything , for all the good folk in the story thought that they were going to get the bannock , and , lo and behold ! the fox got it after all .",
    "alleleiraugh-or-the-many-furred-creature": "there was once upon a time a king who had a wife with golden hair , and she was so beautiful that you could n't find anyone like her in the world . it happened that she fell ill , and when she felt that she must soon die , she sent for the king , and said , ' if you want to marry after my death , make no one queen unless she is just as beautiful as i am , and has just such golden hair as i have . promise me this . ' after the king had promised her this , she closed her eyes and died . for a long time the king was not to be comforted , and he did not even think of taking a second wife . at last his councillors said , ' the king must marry again , so that we may have a queen . ' so messengers were sent far and wide to seek for a bride equal to the late queen in beauty . but there was no one in the wide world , and if there had been she could not have had such golden hair . then the messengers came home again , not having been able to find a queen . now , the king had a daughter , who was just as beautiful as her dead mother , and had just such golden hair . one day when she had grown up , her father looked at her , and saw that she was exactly like her mother , so he said to his councillors , ' i will marry my daughter to one of you , and she shall be queen , for she is exactly like her dead mother , and when i die her husband shall be king . ' but when the princess heard of her father 's decision , she was not at all pleased , and said to him , ' before i do your bidding , i must have three dresses ; one as golden as the sun , one as silver as the moon , and one as shining as the stars . now , the king had a daughter , who was just as beautiful as her dead mother , and had just such golden hair . one day when she had grown up , her father looked at her , and saw that she was exactly like her mother , so he said to his councillors , ' i will marry my daughter to one of you , and she shall be queen , for she is exactly like her dead mother , and when i die her husband shall be king . ' but when the princess heard of her father 's decision , she was not at all pleased , and said to him , ' before i do your bidding , i must have three dresses ; one as golden as the sun , one as silver as the moon , and one as shining as the stars . besides these , i want a cloak made of a thousand different kinds of skin ; every animal in your kingdom must give a bit of his skin to it . ' but she thought to herself , ' this will be quite impossible , and i shall not have to marry someone i do not care for . ' the king , however , was not to be turned from his purpose , and he commanded the most skilled maidens in his kingdom to weave the three dresses , one as golden as the sun , and one as silver as the moon , and one as shining as the stars ; and he gave orders to all his huntsmen to catch one of every kind of beast in the kingdom , and to get a bit of its skin to make the cloak of a thousand pieces of fur . at last , when all was ready , the king commanded the cloak to be brought to him , and he spread it out before the princess , and said , ' tomorrow shall be your wedding - day . ' when the princess saw that there was no more hope of changing her father 's resolution , she determined to flee away . in the night , when everyone else was sleeping , she got up and took three things from her treasures , a gold ring , a little gold spinning - wheel , and a gold reel ; she put the sun , moon , and star dresses in a nut - shell , drew on the cloak of many skins , and made her face and hands black with soot . then she commended herself to god , and went out and travelled the whole night till she came to a large forest . and as she was very much tired she sat down inside a hollow tree and fell asleep .  the sun rose and she still slept on and on , although it was nearly noon . now , it happened that the king to whom this wood belonged was hunting in it . when his dogs came to the tree , they sniffed , and ran round and round it , barking . the king said to the huntsmen , ' see what sort of a wild beast is in there . ' the huntsmen went in , and then came back and said , ' in the hollow tree there lies a wonderful animal that we do n't know , and we have never seen one like it ; its skin is made of a thousand pieces of fur ; but it is lying down asleep . ' the king said , ' see if you can catch it alive , and then fasten it to the cart , and we will take it with us . ' when the huntsmen seized the maiden , she awoke and was frightened , and cried out to them , ' i am a poor child , forsaken by father and mother ; take pity on me , and let me go with you . ' then they said to her , ' many - furred creature , you can work in the kitchen ; come with us and sweep the ashes together . ' so they put her in the cart and they went back to the palace . there they showed her a tiny room under the stairs , where no daylight came , and said to her , ' many - furred creature , you can live and sleep here . ' then she was sent into the kitchen , where she carried wood and water , poked the fire , washed vegetables , plucked fowls , swept up the ashes , and did all the dirty work . so the many - furred creature lived for a long time in great poverty . ah , beautiful king 's daughter , what is going to befall you now ? it happened once when a great feast was being held in the palace , that she said to the cook , ' can i go upstairs for a little bit and look on ? i will stand outside the doors . ' the cook replied , ' yes , you can go up , but in half - an - hour you must be back here to sweep up the ashes . ' then she took her little oil - lamp , and went into her little room , drew off her fur cloak , and washed off the soot from her face and hands , so that her beauty shone forth , and it was as if one sunbeam after another were coming out of a black cloud . then she opened the nut , and took out the dress as golden as the sun . and when she had done this , she went up to the feast , and everyone stepped out of her way , for nobody knew her , and they thought she must be a king 's daughter . but the king came towards her and gave her his hand , and danced with her , thinking to himself , ' my eyes have never beheld anyone so fair ! ' when the dance was ended , she curtseyed to him , and when the king looked round she had disappeared , no one knew whither . the guards who were standing before the palace were called and questioned , but no one had seen her . she had run to her little room and had quickly taken off her dress , made her face and hands black , put on the fur cloak , and was once more the many - furred creature . when she came into the kitchen and was setting about her work of sweeping the ashes together , the cook said to her , ' let that wait till to - morrow , and just cook the king 's soup for me ; i want to have a little peep at the company upstairs ; but be sure that you do not let a hair fall into it , otherwise you will get nothing to eat in future ! ' so the cook went away , and the many - furred creature cooked the soup for the king . she made a bread - soup as well as she possibly could , and when it was done , she fetched her gold ring from her little room , and laid it in the tureen in which the soup was to be served up . when the dance was ended , the king had his soup brought to him and ate it , and it was so good that he thought he had never tasted such soup in his life . but when he came to the bottom of the dish he saw a gold ring lying there , and he could not imagine how it got in . then he commanded the cook to be brought before him . the cook was terrified when he heard the command , and said to the many - furred creature , ' you must have let a hair fall into the soup , and if you have you deserve a good beating ! ' when he came before the king , the king asked who had cooked the soup . the cook answered , ' i cooked it . ' but the king said , ' that 's not true , for it was quite different and much better soup than you have ever cooked . ' then the cook said , ' i must confess ; i did not cook the soup ; the many - furred creature did . ' ' let her be brought before me , ' said the king . when the many - furred creature came , the king asked her who she was . ' i am a poor child without father or mother . ' then he asked her , ' what do you do in my palace ? ' ' i am of no use except to have boots thrown at my head . ' ' how did you get the ring which was in the soup ? ' he asked . ' i know nothing at all about the ring , ' she answered . so the king could find out nothing , and was obliged to send her away . after a time there was another feast , and the many - furred creature begged the cook as at the last one to let her go and look on . he answered , ' yes , but come back again in half - an - hour and cook the king the bread - soup that he likes so much . ' so she ran away to her little room , washed herself quickly , took out of the nut the dress as silver as the moon and put it on . then she went upstairs looking just like a king 's daughter , and the king came towards her , delighted to see her again , and as the dance had just begun , they danced together . it happened once when a great feast was being held in the palace , that she said to the cook , ' can i go upstairs for a little bit and look on ? i will stand outside the doors . ' the cook replied , ' yes , you can go up , but in half - an - hour you must be back here to sweep up the ashes . ' then she took her little oil - lamp , and went into her little room , drew off her fur cloak , and washed off the soot from her face and hands , so that her beauty shone forth , and it was as if one sunbeam after another were coming out of a black cloud . then she opened the nut , and took out the dress as golden as the sun . and when she had done this , she went up to the feast , and everyone stepped out of her way , for nobody knew her , and they thought she must be a king 's daughter . but the king came towards her and gave her his hand , and danced with her , thinking to himself , ' my eyes have never beheld anyone so fair !

' but because she begged hard , he let her go up for the usual time . now she put on the dress as shining as the stars , and stepped into the hall in it . when the many - furred creature came , the king asked her who she was . ' i am a poor child without father or mother . ' then he asked her , ' what do you do in my palace ? ' ' i am of no use except to have boots thrown at my head .
